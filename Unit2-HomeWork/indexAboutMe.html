                <p>
                    Zhuhai-china is the city I grew up with, and I would like to introduce everyone to the city I
                    loved. Zhuhai is a modern city in China’s southern Guangdong province, on the border with Macau.
                    Transformed into one of China’s first Special Economic Zones in 1980, today the city is known for
                    golf resorts, theme parks and islands off the Pearl River Delta.Pedestrianized Lianhua Road and the
                    malls of Jingshan Road are popular shopping areas selling
                    duty-free goods.ZhuHai is a prefecture-level city located on the west bank of Pearl River estuary
                    on the central
                    coast of southern Guangdong province, People's Republic of China, on the southeastern edge of Pearl
                    River Delta.</p>

                <p>
                    ZhuHai is a prefecture-level city located on the west bank of Pearl River estuary on the central
                    coast of southern Guangdong province, People's Republic of China, on the southeastern edge of Pearl
                    River Delta. Its name literally means "pearl sea", which originates from the city's location at the
                    mouth of the Pearl River meeting the South China Sea. Zhuhai borders Jiangmen to the west,
                    Zhongshan to the north and Macau to the southeast,
                    and shares maritime boundaries with Shenzhen and Hong Kong to the northeast across the estuary.
                    Zhuhai was one of the original four Special Economic Zones established in 1980, as well as one of
                    China's premier tourist destinations, being called the Chinese Riviera. While the city is located
                    in
                    the traditionally Cantonese-speaking region of Guangdong, a significant portion of the population
                    is
                    now made up of Mandarin-speaking economic migrants originally from inland provinces.
                    The core of Zhuhai, in the northeastern portion of the administrative division, is part of the
                    Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, the biggest built-up area in the world with more than
                    44,478,513 inhabitants at the 2010 census, encompassing Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan, Zhongshan,
                    Macau, Hong Kong, the main part of Guangzhou, and small parts of Jiangmen and Huizhou cities.
                    According to a report released in 2014 by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Zhuhai is the
                    most
                    livable city in China.
